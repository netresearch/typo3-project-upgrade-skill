# TYPO3 v13 → v14.3 LTS — Project (Instance) Upgrade Playbook

**Release:** v14.3 LTS, 2026-04-21. **Free support:** bugfix until 2027-12-31, security until 2029-06-30.

**Scope:** deployed instance migration — site config, TypoScript, templates, Docker, DB. For extension code migration, see `typo3-extension-upgrade` skill.

## 0. Preflight

- **PHP**: 8.2 floor, 8.5 ceiling. If host runtime is < 8.2, bump the base image first.
- **Database**: MariaDB ≥ 10.4.3, MySQL ≥ 8.0.17, PostgreSQL ≥ 10, SQLite ≥ 3.8.3.
- **Composer**: ≥ 2.1.
- **Disk**: tear-down and rebuild `_processed_/` after upgrade; budget a few GB free.
- Snapshot the instance (DB + `fileadmin/` + config) before proceeding.

## 1. Docker / infrastructure bumps

| Component | v13 → v14 |
|---|---|
| PHP runtime image | bump to PHP 8.2+ (recommend 8.4) |
| ImageMagick | still required — re-verify in new image |
| OS base (Alpine/Debian) | refresh to current security release |
| nginx/Apache | no v14-specific changes |

If you use Netresearch's `support-typo3-14-t3re` runtime image, rebuild it against the 14.3 release.

## 2. composer upgrade

```bash
# Bump the core constraint
composer require --no-update typo3/cms-core:^14.3
composer update -W --with-all-dependencies
```

- v14 requires a `composer.json` in classic mode (#108310). Composer projects already have one.
- `ext_emconf.php` is deprecated for extension metadata (#108345) — not your concern here, but any local extension with only `ext_emconf.php` should be flagged to the extension team.

### Extensions whose motive v14 may have absorbed

Ask what each was installed FOR before budgeting an upgrade for it. Where the core now does that job, the extension is cost without benefit — but the same extension can still be load-bearing in the next project, so this is a per-project question, not a rule.

| Extension | Core now covers | It still earns its place when |
|---|---|---|
| `netresearch/nr-image-optimize` | plain format conversion: `GFX/imageFileConversionFormats` (core since 14.0) delivers WebP/AVIF for every processed image | the site needs retina/srcset variants, a real `<picture>` format fallback, quality steps per URL, or lossless optimisation (optipng/gifsicle/jpegoptim) |

Both outcomes are real and current: one v14 instance dropped it because plain conversion was the only motive, while the netresearch.de v14 relaunch keeps it deliberately for the retina and `/processed` pipeline. Decide it, do not inherit it.

Measured on the Netresearch demo instance: core conversion alone produced about −81 % (1.47 MB → 285 KB) with no extension and no template change. Set it in `additional.php`:

```php
$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['GFX']['imageFileConversionFormats'] = ['svg' => 'svg', 'default' => 'webp'];
```

The encoders still have to exist in the image: imagick and GD both built with WebP and AVIF, and AVIF needs ImageMagick's HEIF coder. Without a working AVIF delegate ImageMagick writes an empty `.avif` instead of failing, so assert real bytes rather than capability flags.

## 3. Site Sets (v13+ — unchanged in v14)

If the v13 site already uses Site Sets, no changes needed. Site configurations are now included in `site:show` import/export (Feature #109340 lands in v14.2). Route enhancers can now ship inside Site Sets (Feature #107837 in v14.1).

## 4. Install Tool / setup

- **`typo3/install.php` removed** — integrated into backend routing (#107536). Existing bookmarks pointing at `/typo3/install.php` need updating to the new backend path. BC is maintained via redirect for most setups.
- **`install:password:set`** CLI (Feature #104058) — unattended install admin password rotation.

## 5. Post-upgrade security wizards

### Important #109585 — serialized credential data

**Applies to any site that ran v14.2 (at any point)**. Password changes during v14.2 runtime may have persisted serialized plaintext into `be_users.uc` / `user_settings`.

- Install Tool → Upgrade → Upgrade Wizards
- Wizard auto-appears when applicable
- It unserializes, strips password fields, re-serializes

**Skip**: sites upgrading v13 → v14.3 directly.

### HMAC rotation (#106307)

HMAC algorithm strengthened SHA1 → SHA256 family. Invalidates any HMACs persisted before the upgrade:
- One-time tokens (e.g. password-reset tokens, form tokens)
- Signed serialized payloads in custom extensions

Action: force regeneration at next use (or flush proactively if safe).

## 6. Frontend theme migration (optional)

v14.1 introduced **Camino** as a self-contained default theme (#108539). Four color schemes, configurable nav/footer. Alternative to `bootstrap-package`:

- Opt-in per site: add Camino dependency in `Configuration/Sites/<id>/config.yaml`.
- Camino will move to TER / Packagist in v15, not bundled with core forever.
- Existing bootstrap-package sites stay on bootstrap-package (no forced migration).

## 7. Backend UI changes (operator awareness)

- Redesigned DocHeader (breadcrumb + unified lang selector).
- Modal migrated to native `<dialog>` (#107443) — accessibility improvement.
- Bookmark manager replaces shortcuts (#108796).
- QR Code module (#107756) and Short URL module (#108826) via redirect system.
- Bootstrap Modal → native dialog breaks any custom JS that invoked `Modal.advanced` — verify extension vendors.
- Dark/Light mode in CKEditor RTE enabled by default (#106964).

## 8. TypoScript cleanups (deprecations → removals)

Removed in v14.0 (fix before cutover):

- `<INCLUDE_TYPOSCRIPT: ...>` → `@import`
- `TypoScript condition getTSFE()` removed (#107473)
- `config.tx_extbase.persistence.updateReferenceIndex` (#106041) — remove
- TSconfig `options.pageTree.backgroundColor` — use CSS custom properties
- `$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['BE']['defaultPageTSconfig']` + `defaultUserTSconfig` — use site-level TSconfig
- Plugin subtypes: `tt_content.list_type` is gone, `list_type` plugin registrations must become CType-only

New opt-in required:

- TypoScript/TSconfig callables (`userFunc`) require explicit allow-listing (#108054)

## 9. v15-preparation (fix in v14 cycle before v15)

`ext_tables.php` deprecated in v14.3 (#109438). Even for project-level configurations that live in a "sitepackage" extension, split `ext_tables.php` into:

- `Configuration/Backend/Modules.php`
- `Configuration/Backend/Routes.php`
- `ext_localconf.php` (`ExtensionManagementUtility::addUserSetting()` — the Setup module API, not a TCA override)
- `Configuration/TCA/Overrides/pages.php` (`allowedRecordTypes`)

## 10. Smoke tests after cutover

```bash
# FE render
curl -si https://site/ | head -5
# BE login
curl -si https://site/typo3/ | head -5
# Processed images exist
ls public/fileadmin/_processed_/ | wc -l
# No deprecations in log
grep -ic deprecat var/log/typo3_*.log

# DB: no leftover sys_template root=1 records
ddev mysql -e "SELECT uid, pid, title FROM sys_template WHERE root=1 AND deleted=0"  # or: mysql -u${DB_USER} -p${DB_PASSWORD} ${DB_NAME} -e '...'
```

## 11. LTS support window (operational)

| Version | Bugfix end | Security end |
|---|---|---|
| **v14.3 LTS** (today's cutover target) | 2027-12-31 | 2029-06-30 |
| v13 LTS | 2027-10-31 (approx.) | +ELTS |
| v12 LTS | **2026-04-30** (imminent) | +ELTS |
| v11.5 | 2024-10 (ended) | +ELTS 2028-10-31 |

**Do not upgrade a production site to v14.0/14.1/14.2 in the sprint window** — those releases lost support when 14.3 shipped.
